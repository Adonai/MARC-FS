 * @brief The MruData class - filesystem-wide metadata and caching for the mounted filesystem.

 * Each file-altering operation obtains a lock on specified file. In addition, cache lock
 * is taken each time new node appears/disappears/opened.
 *
 * @note It is implied that you do not alter any information on the cloud while
 *       it is mounted somewhere via MARC-FS as cache is built only once and then
 *       considered immutable.
